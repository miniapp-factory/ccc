```
A slot machine with 3 columns and 3 rows, each slot contains one fruit. The fruits should be: Apple, Banana, Cherry, Lemon. Generate an vector style image with white background for each fruit and use it to display that fruit. The fruits should be spawned by the machine at random. The user can press the spin button, which will trigger a spinning animation that moves the columns downward, spawning new fruit at the top repeatedly for 2 seconds. If there are 3 of the same fruit in any row or column at any time while not spinning, display a win message to the user, which they can share on their feed. Check the win condition directly using a conditional render instead of calculating it in a function. The user should always be able to spin again, except while the spinning animation is in progress.

Place the slot machine to the home page.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the slot‑machine feature, generate the app logo, and update the metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to place the slot‑machine component on the home page.  
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app title and description.  
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo.  
4. `mini-app/components/slot-machine.tsx` – new component that implements the slot‑machine logic and UI.  
5. `mini-app/public/apple.png.todo` – vector image for Apple.  
6. `mini-app/public/banana.png.todo` – vector image for Banana.  
7. `mini-app/public/cherry.png.todo` – vector image for Cherry.  
8. `mini-app/public/lemon.png.todo` – vector image for Lemon.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks (or new‑file blocks) for the changes.
